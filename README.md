🎓 I recently completed the learning part of a 12-month Data Science Certificate at ExploreAI Academy, where I gained hands-on experience in a variety of data science techniques and tools. I am currently doing a 4-months internship  at Telkom(Consumer Group), as part of the ExploreAI Academy programme so that I can apply what I have learnt throughout the year towards solving real-life problems. My journey involves everything from foundational data processing to building machine learning models, and I’m excited to share my work with you!✨
